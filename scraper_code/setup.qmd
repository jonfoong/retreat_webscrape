Set up by installing packages

```{r}

packages <- c("rvest", "dplyr", "kableExtra", "ggplot2",
              "webdriver", "httr", "stringr", "lubridate",
              "jsonlite")

install.packages(packages)


```

Now we install phantomjs. Let me know if you do not have admin permissions and cannot install

```{r}

webdriver::install_phantomjs()

```
